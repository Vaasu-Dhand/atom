### BUGS
1) create-ts-index creats a .bak file, I dont know why
2) Indexify JS probably does not wotk with JSX files

### TODO
1) Work on Error Handling
3) Add Greeting in the welome function { Good Morning, etc }
4) Do I have to add support for JSX/TSX?
5) Could not find the recursive style, will have to code on my own
6) I have not added flags to indexify (a 3rd prompt), just because I dont think its useful
7) Auto Complete folder names in CLI
8) Remember Folder paths in Indexify
